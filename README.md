# \#CapitalOne MindSummo Challenge
## This is a node.js app I made for the #CapitalOne MindSummo Challenge. Here is what it does;
* Get the 20 most recent posts from Instagram with #CapitalOne
* For each of those posts, get information about the poster including their following ratio and how many posts they have.
* Use AlchemyAPI to get the sentiment of each post's caption
* On the linked page at the top plot sentiment over time using D3.js (poorly I might add)

##Here are the instructions for running this application
First of all, clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/faizanv/CapitalOneInstagram.git`
